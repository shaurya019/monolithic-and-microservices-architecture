The Saga pattern is a design pattern for handling distributed transactions in microservices architecture. In a microservice-based system, a single business transaction might span multiple services. Each service has its own database, and ensuring data consistency across these services can be challenging. The Saga pattern provides a way to manage this by breaking the transaction into a series of smaller, isolated steps, each managed by a different service.

Types of Sagas
Choreography-based Sagas:

In this approach, each service involved in the transaction performs its work and then publishes an event.
Other services listen to these events and react accordingly.
This pattern is decentralized, with no central coordinator.
Orchestration-based Sagas:

A central orchestrator manages the entire transaction.
The orchestrator sends commands to the services involved.
Each service performs its task and replies back to the orchestrator.
How It Works
Saga Steps:

Each step in the Saga represents a single transaction performed by a service.
A step is either a compensatable transaction (if it can be undone) or a pivot transaction (if it commits the final state).
Compensating Transactions:

If a step in the Saga fails, compensating transactions are invoked to undo the previous steps.
This ensures eventual consistency.
