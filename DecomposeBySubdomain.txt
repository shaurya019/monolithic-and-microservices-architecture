Decompose by Subdomain
Concept: Use Domain-Driven Design (DDD) to break down the application into subdomains. Each subdomain corresponds to a microservice.

Example: Banking Application
In a banking application, the main subdomains might include accounts, loans, transactions, and customer service. Based on these subdomains, the application can be decomposed into the following microservices:

Account Service

Responsibilities: Managing customer accounts, account creation, updates, and closures.
Endpoints:
POST /accounts
GET /accounts/{accountId}
PUT /accounts/{accountId}
DELETE /accounts/{accountId}
Loan Service

Responsibilities: Handling loan applications, loan approvals, and repayment schedules.
Endpoints:
POST /loans
GET /loans/{loanId}
PUT /loans/{loanId}
GET /loans/customer/{customerId}
Transaction Service

Responsibilities: Managing financial transactions, transaction history, and account statements.
Endpoints:
POST /transactions
GET /transactions/{transactionId}
GET /transactions/account/{accountId}
GET /transactions/customer/{customerId}
Customer Service

Responsibilities: Handling customer inquiries, support tickets, and customer relationship management.
Endpoints:
POST /customers
GET /customers/{customerId}
PUT /customers/{customerId}
DELETE /customers/{customerId}
POST /customers/support
By decomposing the application into these microservices based on subdomains, each service encapsulates a distinct area of the business domain, promoting better domain modeling, reduced complexity, and improved separation of concerns.
