Decompose by Business Capability
Concept: Identify and define microservices based on business capabilities. Each microservice is responsible for a specific business function.

Example: eCommerce Application
In an eCommerce application, the main business capabilities might include user management, product catalog, order processing, payment, and shipping. Based on these capabilities, the application can be decomposed into the following microservices:

User Management Service

Responsibilities: User registration, login, profile management, and authentication.
Endpoints:
POST /users/register
POST /users/login
GET /users/profile
PUT /users/profile
Product Catalog Service

Responsibilities: Managing product listings, categories, search functionality, and inventory.
Endpoints:
GET /products
GET /products/{id}
POST /products
PUT /products/{id}
DELETE /products/{id}
GET /categories
Order Processing Service

Responsibilities: Handling customer orders, order status updates, and order history.
Endpoints:
POST /orders
GET /orders/{id}
PUT /orders/{id}
GET /orders/user/{userId}
Payment Service

Responsibilities: Processing payments, managing payment gateways, and handling refunds.
Endpoints:
POST /payments
GET /payments/{orderId}
POST /payments/refund
Shipping Service

Responsibilities: Managing shipping logistics, tracking shipments, and handling delivery notifications.
Endpoints:
POST /shipping
GET /shipping/{orderId}
PUT /shipping/{orderId}
By decomposing the application into these microservices, each service focuses on a specific business capability, leading to more modular, scalable, and maintainable architecture.
